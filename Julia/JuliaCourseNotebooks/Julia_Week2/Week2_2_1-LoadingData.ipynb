    "\n",
    "Here is a special Julia moment: our first time to load a package explicitly. \n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in an earlier lecture, Julia consists of some basics that are always loaded, plus extensions that can be additionally loaded. One of these is the DelimitedFiles package, which is part of the standard library, but in order to use it, you have to load it. To do so is very simple: you just enter ``using DelimitedFiles``. We need it to read the .csv file of EVD data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But *why* do we need to load the DelimitedFiles package? Why isn't it available out of the box, when you start up Julia?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is efficiency, of two kinds. First there is starting-up efficiency, then there is functionality efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting-up efficiency is achieved by not cluttering the starting-up process with all kinds of features that aren't essential to starting up. Most programs go a little beyond the absolute minimum, though, and Julia is no exception. However, although .csv files are very often used, they are only one of many kinds of delimited files. It is part of the Julia philosophy to put related functionalities together in one place, so the methods for reading and writing delimited files are all in the DelimitedFiles package. This makes it both quite large and full of features that are only rarely needed---in other words, it makes DelimitedFiles incompatible with starting-up efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality efficiency is achieved by making it easy to find the functionality you need, quick to write the code you need, and for this code to run optimally fast. How this is achieved is an advanced topic, but one thing is clear: making it possible read a .csv file in out-of-the box Julia does not necessarily help with any of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you see here is a strong element of Julia's design, which values consistency and efficiency above convenience."
