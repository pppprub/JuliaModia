    "This is related to the fact that many functions allow, or even require, more than one input value. For example, ``binomial`` requires two values, and ``muladd()`` requires three (look them up!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, functions must accept inputs of more than one type. For instance, if we enter ``cos(1)`` then we are sending a value with type ``Int64`` to Julia's ``cos()`` function. And if we enter \"``cos(1.)`` we are sending a value of type ``Float64``. But the value created by Julia's ``cos()`` function in both cases is 0.5403023058681398.\n",

    "Which is exactly what we want, of course. BUT!\n",
    "\n",
    "A function name points to a code body. When the code actually executes, it should be specialised on one type, else it will run very slowly, if at all. A function such as ``cos()`` actually has several such code bodies, to deal with inputs of different types. These are called the *methods* of that function. So how do Julia functions manage to have only one name, but many methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is multiple dispatch: Julia allows many methods, as long as they differ according to input type. All the input values are used to check this, hence the name multiple dispatch. The pattern of types in the input values in a given function call is its *type signature*. For example, ``muladd()`` has 12 permissible type signatures, which we see by using the function methods():"
